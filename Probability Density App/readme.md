This project is an interactive web application that plots various probability density functions and computes probabilities of based on those distributions.  It uses the Shiny web application. This repository contains two files

- `ui.R`- Defines the user interface for the application
- `server.R` - the server script that responds to user input and performs the actual computations

A running version of the app is available [here](https://jthurman.shinyapps.io/DistributionExplorer/)
