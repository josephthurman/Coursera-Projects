# Projects from the Coursera Data Science Specialization

This repository contains some of my projects from various courses in the Data Science Specialization offered by Johns Hopkins on Coursera.

The various projects are
1.	An exploratory data analysis on emissions data obtained from the EPA
2.	Scripts to tidy the UCI HAR dataset of acceleration/orientation data recorded by a smartphone for participants engaged in various physical activities
3.	Building simple machine learning models to predict the activity of a participant in a study from smartphone data similar to the above
4.	An analysis of the economic costs and human casualties associated to storms from National Weather Service data
5.	An interactive web application to visualize the density functions of various probability distributions
